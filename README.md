# Travel Destinations


A small web application to manage places I'd like to visit. It now includes a lightweight Node.js backend for storing destinations.

## Features

- Add new destinations through a simple form
- Data is persisted on the server in `data.json`
- Toggle dark mode for night browsing (preference saved in local storage)

## Getting Started

1. Run `node server.js` from this directory.
2. Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
3. Add destinations and toggle dark mode as desired.

All changes are automatically saved to `data.json` while the server is running.
